# Missing trailing newline when writing output to a file

## Symptom

When the Rust tool writes its JSON output to a file (as opposed to
stdout), the output lacks a trailing newline. The Java golden files
all end with a trailing newline character (`\n`). This causes a 1-byte
difference in every single output file.

For files where all other formatting already matches (e.g.,
`union.avdl`), this is the ONLY remaining byte-level difference.

## Root cause

In `src/main.rs`, the `write_output` function at line 429 calls
`fs::write(&path, content)` with the serialized JSON string, which
does not include a trailing newline. The stdout path at line 425 uses
`print!("{content}")`, also without a trailing newline, but the
comment says "matching Java behavior" -- however, Java's
`Protocol.toString(true)` does not include a trailing newline either,
while its file-writing paths use `PrintStream.print()` (not
`println()`) but the golden files on disk DO have trailing newlines.

The golden files in the Avro repository end with `\n`, so either the
golden files were hand-edited or generated by a path that appends a
newline (e.g., `PrintStream.println()` in `IdlToSchemataTool.print()`
at line 102, which explicitly uses `println`).

## Affected files

- `src/main.rs` -- `write_output` function (line ~429)
- ALL 18 golden file comparisons show this difference

## Reproduction

```sh
cargo run -- idl avro/lang/java/idl/src/test/idl/input/union.avdl tmp/union.avpr
diff tmp/union.avpr avro/lang/java/idl/src/test/idl/output/union.avpr
# Output: "38c38 < }\ No newline at end of file --- > }"
wc -c tmp/union.avpr avro/lang/java/idl/src/test/idl/output/union.avpr
# 751 tmp/union.avpr
# 752 output/union.avpr
```

## Suggested fix

Append a trailing newline to the output string before writing to a
file:

```rust
fs::write(&path, format!("{content}\n"))
```

Or append it only when writing to a file (not stdout), to match the
Java behavior where `IdlTool` uses `parseOut.print()` (no newline for
stdout) but the golden files have newlines (suggesting the test
infrastructure adds them).

## Priority

Low individually, but fixing this would immediately make `union.avdl`
byte-perfect and reduce diff noise for all 18 files.
