/**
 * Regression: .avsc file with a leading block comment.
 *
 * Java's Schema.parse() uses Jackson with ALLOW_COMMENTS enabled, so it
 * silently strips C-style and C++-style comments before parsing JSON.
 * Our Rust import_schema uses serde_json which requires strict JSON and
 * rejects any leading non-JSON content.
 *
 * Source: cloudera/flume flume-core/src/main/avro/avroflumereport.avsc
 * (minimized from the original 3-field record to a single field)
